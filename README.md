# JSnotes

A basic note app in vanilla javascript with bootstrap styles and localStorage API.
This is a beginner project for me and is in its first stage.

**Current features**
* Create a note and save it to localStorage
* See the last note you wrote
* See all of your notes
* Delete a specific note
* Delete all notes

Known bugs are in the issues section 😅

**Future features**
- [ ] Edit a note ✍️
- [ ] Paginate all notes 📓
